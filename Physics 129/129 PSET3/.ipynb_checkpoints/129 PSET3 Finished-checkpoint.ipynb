Scientists use the term confidence level to describe how well we can tell two hypothesis apart  A 90\\%\\ confidence level separation means that it we start with equal populations in the two possibilities, we will choose the wrong hypothesis 10\\%\\ of the time.

The probability of getting the wrong assignment with this strategty is called a one-sided confidence limit.  In our case, we must ask that $10\\% $ of the events be in one tail (so\n",

    "In this problem we will study how the position resolution of a detector depends upon the properties of that detector. For our example, we will consider a silicon strip detector. We will describe our detector as an $x$-$y$ plane segmented into strips, each of width $\\ell$ in the $y$-direction. When a track moving in the $z$-direction passes through the plane, it deposits energy in the detector and that energy is collected using charge sensitive ampliﬁers (one per strip). You many assume that the incident track is normal to the silicon plane. Looking down on the strip detector (so that the incident tracks are traveling into the page), the detector looks like this:"
